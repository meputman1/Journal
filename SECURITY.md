# Security Documentation - Journal App

## Overview
This is a demo journal application that stores data locally in the user's browser. While we've implemented several security measures, this app is designed for demonstration purposes and should not be used for storing sensitive information in production environments.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Password Security
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using SHA-256 with a salt before storage
- **Strong Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number
- **Password Migration**: Existing plain-text passwords are automatically migrated to hashed versions

### 2. Session Management
- **Session-based Authentication**: Uses sessionStorage for session management instead of persistent localStorage
- **Session Expiration**: Sessions expire after 24 hours
- **Automatic Session Validation**: Sessions are validated on app startup

### 3. Input Sanitization
- **XSS Prevention**: User inputs are sanitized to prevent script injection
- **HTML Escaping**: Special characters are escaped to prevent HTML injection

### 4. Rate Limiting
- **Login Attempt Limiting**: Maximum 5 failed login attempts per email
- **Account Lockout**: 15-minute lockout period after exceeding attempt limit
- **Automatic Reset**: Lockout resets after the time period

### 5. Data Isolation
- **User-specific Storage**: Each user's data is stored with a unique key
- **Session Clearing**: All sensitive data is cleared on logout

## Security Limitations

### 1. Client-Side Storage
- **localStorage Vulnerability**: All data is stored in the browser's localStorage
- **No Server-side Validation**: All authentication happens client-side
- **Browser Access**: Anyone with access to the browser can view stored data

### 2. No Encryption
- **Plain Text Storage**: Journal entries are stored in plain text
- **No End-to-End Encryption**: Data is not encrypted at rest

### 3. No Network Security
- **No HTTPS**: No transport layer security
- **No API Security**: No backend API with proper authentication

## Recommendations for Production Use

### 1. Backend Implementation
- Implement a secure backend server with proper authentication
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper session management with JWT tokens
- Add rate limiting on the server side

### 2. Data Encryption
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Implement end-to-end encryption for journal entries
- Use secure key management

### 3. Additional Security Measures
- Implement two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Add audit logging for security events
- Implement data backup and recovery procedures
- Add account recovery mechanisms

### 4. Privacy Compliance
- Implement GDPR compliance features
- Add data export and deletion capabilities
- Implement proper data retention policies

## Current Security Measures

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- Special characters allowed: @$!%*?&

### Session Security
- Sessions expire after 24 hours
- Sessions are stored in sessionStorage (cleared when browser closes)
- Automatic session validation on app startup

### Data Protection
- User-specific storage keys prevent data mixing
- Input sanitization prevents XSS attacks
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks

## Security Notice
This application is designed for educational and demonstration purposes. It should not be used to store sensitive or confidential information. For production use, implement a proper backend with industry-standard security measures.
